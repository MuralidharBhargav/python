To build a central metadata repository combining:
Layer	Metadata Type	Examples
Operational Metadata	Freshness, Data Arrival, ETL job status, Runtime stats	Dataproc job start/end, GCS file arrival times
Technical Metadata	Schema, Tables, Views, Owners, Last Queried, Row counts, Size	BigQuery metadata, DDL history
Business Metadata	Business usage mapping, Owners, Tags	Which views serve dashboards, Business SLA expectations

✅ Ultimate goals:

    Searchable repository across these three levels.

    Visualize lineage end-to-end.

    Use Google Data Catalog as the base system.

📚 Based on your goal, here’s the full professional checklist you need to prepare:
1. 📂 Data Catalog Setup

✅ Entry Groups organized for different kinds of assets:
Entry Group	Purpose
raw_data_files	GCS file objects
processing_jobs	Dataproc job runs (operational lineage)
warehouse_tables	BigQuery tables (technical metadata)
business_views	BI or analytic views (business mapping)

✅ Make sure Entry Groups are created and permissioned properly.
2. 📜 Tag Templates Creation

✅ Create structured Tag Templates for each metadata dimension:
Tag Template	Fields (examples)
Operational Metadata Tag	job_id, job_status, start_time, end_time, source_file, records_processed
Technical Metadata Tag	owner, table_type (table/view), created_time, last_modified_time, schema_version, last_query_time, num_rows, size_bytes
Business Metadata Tag	business_owner, criticality (high/med/low), SLA_time, business_process_name

✅ These Tag Templates allow structured metadata to be attached to assets.

✅ Use enums, timestamps, and string fields where needed.
3. 🔍 Search and Discovery Layer

✅ Plan search interfaces based on:
Search Type	Metadata Used
Table search by owner or last queried	Technical metadata tags
File search by freshness or missing SLA	Operational metadata tags
Business asset search by owner / process name	Business metadata tags

✅ You will need:

    search_catalog APIs

    Tag-based search

    Full-text search across descriptions/fields

✅ Maybe build a simple Streamlit front-end for search!
4. 🌐 Lineage Collection and Visualization

✅ Map this flow:

GCS File → Dataproc Job → BigQuery Staging Table → BigQuery Master Table → Business View / Dashboard

✅ Collect nodes and edges:
Asset	Example
GCS File	gs://bucket/path/file.csv
Dataproc Job	job_123456
BQ Staging Table	project.dataset.staging_table
BQ Master Table	project.dataset.master_table
BI View	project.dataset.business_view

✅ Use tools like networkx and graphviz to plot this lineage.
5. 🛠 Automations

✅ Build pipelines to:

    Periodically collect metadata (operational and technical)

    Sync fresh metadata into Data Catalog

    Refresh lineage graphs daily or hourly

    Monitor stale data assets

✅ Examples:

    Pub/Sub on GCS bucket events triggers freshness metadata updates.

    Dataproc Job completion writes operational metadata.

    BigQuery logs parsed to update last queried times.

6. 🛡️ Security and Governance

✅ Make sure:

    Metadata repository access is IAM controlled.

    Sensitive metadata (ex: PII indicators) tagged separately.

    Metadata changes are logged.

7. 📈 Visualization

✅ Build:

    Search Dashboard (Streamlit / Looker)

    Lineage Viewer (networkx/Graphviz or custom D3.js visualization)

✅ Show:

    Operational Health status

    Table Usage reports

    Freshness/SLA monitors

✅ Operational Metadata | Technical Metadata | Business Metadata — all flow into Data Catalog!
🚀 Next, I suggest:

✅ Design your Tag Templates first
✅ Create Entry Groups structure
✅ Then build small scripts for:

    Metadata collection

    Tag attachment

    Search indexing

    Lineage graph plotting

📣 Would you like me to next:

✅ Help you draft the Tag Templates YAMLs
✅ Show you how to create them using gcloud commands / Python
✅ Help you design your Data Catalog Entry naming conventions

👉 Just say "yes help me with tag templates and naming" 🚀

✅ You're architecting this exactly like a real enterprise metadata system!
Ready to move to Tag Template design next? 🎯🚀

Would you like me to show the next steps for Tags and Templates? (critical!) ✅
